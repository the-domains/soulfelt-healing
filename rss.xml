            <title><![CDATA[Stitching Prayers: Mending Life's Tapestry]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Stitching Prayers: Mending Life's Tapestry</h1><p>While I contemplated the state of our world this morning I received the inspiration to begin "stitching" my prayers each day. The metaphor is that each stitch becomes a prayerful gesture of the intention for God's mending of whomever and whatever is torn, broken, and in need of God's Love, Mercy, Grace, and Healing.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1f7f6c7262de232ce6a7c354d38ffd59/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=640&cropwidth=480&degrees=-90&input=http%3A%2F%2Fsibyldanareynolds.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2FIMG_0935.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Recharging your sacred practice</h1><p>Last week, I had the luxury of taking a few days of vacation in the Finger Lakes region of New York. Each morning I found myself drawn to sit in the side yard of our cottage that overlooked Seneca Lake. It was there that I would meditate and pray.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/34732fb4-af7c-4773-8172-b8e54d3eca07.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why You Need to Love Yourself More</h1><p>I used to believe that love meant putting everyone else and their needs first, before my own. While I do think there is some truth to that, in the sense that being a giving person is one of the ultimate acts of being a loving person, I came to realize that I must give to and love myself first and foremost.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/75b6a2a90ce8ffccabb83684f228ad6037de398f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
