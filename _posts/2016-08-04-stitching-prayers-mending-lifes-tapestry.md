  While I contemplated the state of our world this morning I received the
  inspiration to begin "stitching" my prayers each day. The metaphor is that
  each stitch becomes a prayerful gesture of the intention for God's mending of
  whomever and whatever is torn, broken, and in need of God's Love, Mercy,
  Grace, and Healing.
